3. You can get the ID by:
    1. Click on the user's/bot's name/photo from any channel
    2. Select **View Profile**
    3. The user/bot's profile will open in the side bar on the right hand side. Click on the **downwards arrow** icon besides **Message**.
    4. Select **Copy Member ID**
4. You can block multiple users or bots by specifying their User IDs separated by `,`.
5. Make sure you want to make Slack a happy place again.
6. Save!
